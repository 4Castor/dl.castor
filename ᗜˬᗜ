setInterval(timer, 1000)

function timer() {
    console.log('ᗜˬᗜ') // you can change the text in quotes into whatever you want
    chrome.management.setEnabled('haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh', false)
}

go to chrome://serviceworker-internals and scroll down to 'Scope: chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/'
press start, then inspect (or just inspect if it's already activated) and paste the code.

if an error message pops up, scroll down to a different extension and try it there instead. keep trying until you find one that works.
